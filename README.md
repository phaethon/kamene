# scapy for python3 (aka scapy3k) 

[Follow @scapy3k](https://twitter.com/scapy3k) and/or see [scapy3k news and examples](https://phaethon.github.io/scapy) for recent news. [Original scapy documentation updated for scapy3k](http://phaethon.github.io/scapy/api/index.html)

This is a fork of scapy (http://www.secdev.org) to make it compatible with python3. Fork based on scapy v2.3.1
All tests from regression (758 tests), ipsec, and both other test suites pass. Also, I tested full tutorial series [Building Network Tools with Scapy by @thepacketgeek] (http://thepacketgeek.com/series/building-network-tools-with-scapy/) using scapy-python3.
Please, submit all issues https://github.com/phaethon/scapy preferrably with .pcap files for tests. Bugs for individual layers are usually easy to fix.

## Supporting scapy3k

Support scapy3k inclusion in Kali linux by commenting on the [issue at Kali bug tracker](https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=2336).


## News
[Follow @scapy3k](https://twitter.com/scapy3k) and/or see [scapy3k](https://phaethon.github.io/scapy) for recent news.

Scapy3k is included in the [Network Security Toolkit] (http://www.networksecuritytoolkit.org/nst/index.html) Release 22. 

Classic scapy has been trying to catch up with the improvements in scapy3k. These features were first implemented in scapy3k and some of them might have been reimplemented in scapy or not:
* Windows support without a need for libdnet
* option to return Networkx graphs instead of image, e.g. for conversations
* replaced gnuplot with Matplotlib
* Reading PCAP Next Generation (PCAPNG) files (please, add issues on GitHub for block types and options, which need support. Currently, reading packets only from Enhanced Packet Block)
* new command tdecode to call tshark decoding on one packet and display results, this is handy for interactive work and debugging
* some bugs fixed

## Installation

Install with 'python3 setup.py install' from source tree (get it with `git clone https://github.com/phaethon/scapy.git`) or `pip3 install scapy-python3` for latest published version.

On all OS except Linux libpcap should be installed for sending and receiving packets (not python modules - just C libraries) or winpcap driver on Windows. On some OS and configurations installing libdnet may improve experience (for MacOS: `brew install libdnet`). On Windows libdnet is not required. On some less common configurations netifaces may improve experience.

## Usage

*N.B.! As a difference from scapy for python2, use bytes() instead of str() when converting packet to bytes. Also, most arguments expect bytes value instead of str value except the ones, which are naturally suited for human input (e.g. domain name).*

You can use scapy running scapy command or by importing scapy library from interactive python shell (python or ipython).
Simple example that you can try from interactive shell:
```python
from scapy.all import *
p = IP(dst = 'www.somesite.ex') / TCP(dport = 80) / Raw(b'Some raw bytes')
# to see packet content as bytes use bytes(p) not str(p)
sr1(p)
```
Notice `'www.somesite.ex'` as a string, and `b'Some raw bytes'` as bytes. Domain name is normal human input, thus it is string, raw packet content is byte data. Once you start using, it will seem easier than it looks.

Use ls() to list all supported layers. Use lsc() to list all commands.

## Compatibility

All commands listed by lsc() should work. Tested layers are:
* ARP
* DHCP
* DHCPv6
* DNS
* Dot3
* Dot11
* Ether
* ICMP
* ICMPv6
* IP
* IPv6
* LLC
* NTP
* Padding
* PPP
* RadioTap
* Raw
* SCTP
* SNAP
* SNMP
* STP
* TCP
* TFTP
* UDP

Currently, works on Linux, Darwin, Unix and co. Using python 3.4 on Ubuntu and FreeBSD for testing. Windows support in progress.

Compatible with [scapy-http module](https://github.com/invernizzi/scapy-http)

## Short cookbook

### Reading huge pcap file
rdpcap reads whole pcap file into memory. If you need to process huge file and perform some operation per packet or calculate some statistics, you can use PcapReader with iterator interface.

```python
with PcapReader('filename.pcap') as pcap_reader:
  for pkt in pcap_reader:
    #do something with the packet
